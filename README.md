# Airline-Database

Created an airline databse form scratch in SSMS with SQL and a C# interface using Microsoft WinForms.

Implemented both back end and front end with user login and multiple user access restrictions. The UI is simple and smooth, with a very understandable design and layout.

Through the C# app, the user can create, insert, modify and delete various fields and tables from the database. The information can also be queried and refreshed everytime a change has been made in the DB.
